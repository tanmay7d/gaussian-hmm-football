"""
joint_emission.py — Estimate the joint emission tensor P(outcome | state_team, state_opp).

Each team has its own HMM telling us the probability distribution over
its hidden form (Poor/Neutral/Peak) right before a match. But a match
outcome depends on BOTH teams' states. We learn a tensor

    T[i, j, o] = P(outcome = o | team_state = i, opp_state = j)

by accumulating soft counts over historical matches: for every match we
take the predictive state distributions for both teams (using ONLY
prior outcomes — no leakage) and add their outer product into the slice
of T at the observed outcome. Laplace smoothing then a normalize over
the outcome axis gives proper probabilities.
